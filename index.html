            <p>
                I’m an enthusiastic developer with a soft spot for software design, clean code, design & AI related
                topics
                based in Vienna, Austria. I'm always looking for new ideas and fun technologies to make amazing Products
                come to life. I consider myself a generalist, a jack of all trades and master of none.
                The perfect setup to be dedicated to the art of product development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working on full-stack projects gives me a great balance and is the perfect way to combine my
                diverse passions into something productive.
                To me versatility is key in staying excited and up to date, gaining knowledge consistently.
                Which is why I tend to just “try it out”, that’s how I got into this career after all.

                    After learning PHP basics, I was intrigued to find out what I'd be able

                    This project got me a understanding of what it means to tackle security
                    issues and following best practices.
